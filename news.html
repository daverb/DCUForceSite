        <b>DCU Force</b> is the mens rugby club of Dublin
					City University. We have three teams competing in competition, the
					1st XV competes in Division 1 of the Irish Colleges league, the 2nd
					team competes in Division 3 and we also have a Fresher's team
					competing in the Fresher's division. As we are a University team
					players are representing DCU, therefore players can come from any
					club in Ireland and it does not effect their playing status.<br><br>
                    
					Training normally runs on Monday evenings in the DCU Sports Grounds
					and league games take place on Wednesdays.<br><br> The club has developed
					immeasurably over the last number of years with the appointment of
					a rugby development officer and increasing our number of
					scholarship players from 4 to 8. A number of our past players have
					gone on to professional careers including Bernard Jackman and Jamie
					Heaslip to name but two. <br><br>
                    As well as having players playing in the
					top tiers of Irish rugby we also cater for beginners who want to
					learn the core skills of the game and host regular beginners
					orientated training sessions throughout the college year.<br><br> Off the
					pitch the club has a busy social side with regular trips, events
					and nights out. It's a great place for students to come and meet
					some friends and get involved in extra curricular college life.<br><br> To
					find out a bit more information about joining the club, training
					times or anything else contact us on the club email address or any
					of our committee members and we'll be happy to provide more
					details.</p></td>
